cpmtools - Tools to access CP/M file systems
============================================


This package allows to access CP/M file systems similar to the well-known
mtools package, which accesses MSDOS file systems. It can be used for file
exchange with a Z80-PC simulator, but it works on floppy devices as well.

All features of CP/M file systems are supported.
